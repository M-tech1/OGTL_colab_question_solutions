Given a string ‘str’ that consists of only upper/lower case letters and empty space characters ‘ ‘, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0. 

You can use the language of your choice.

## Example:

-	Str = “Learning is fun”, return 3

### Function Prototype in JS (you can do this in any language)

}
