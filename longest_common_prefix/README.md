# Topic: Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Example 0:
●	Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
●	Output: "fl"

## Example 1:
●	Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
●	Output: ""
●	Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## Constraints
●	1 <= strs.length <= 200
●	0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
●	strs[i] consists of only lower-case English letters.

Prototype in C (you can do this in any language)
char * longestCommonPrefix(char ** strs, int strsSize){

}

### Prototype in JS (you can do this in any language)
function longestCommonPrefix(strs){

}
